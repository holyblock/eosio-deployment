# Deploying C++ Smart Contract to WAX Blockchain

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to deploy a C++ smart contract to the WAX blockchain.

## Prerequisites

1. **Install EOSIO software**: You need the EOSIO software installed on your system.
2. **Install Nodeos**: Nodeos is the core service daemon that runs an EOSIO blockchain.
3. **Install CMake**: CMake is used to build the smart contract.
4. **Install CDT (Contract Development Toolkit)**: EOSIO.CDT is a suite of tools used to build EOSIO smart contracts.

## Steps to Deploy C++ Smart Contract to WAX Blockchain

### 1. Set up WAX Blockchain Environment
- Set up a local or testnet environment using Nodeos.
- Create a WAX account and obtain WAX tokens for deployment fees.

### 2. Write the Smart Contract
Write your smart contract in C++. Ensure it follows EOSIO standards. Example:

```cpp
#include <eosio/eosio.hpp>

using namespace eosio;

class [[eosio::contract]] example : public contract {
public:
   using contract::contract;

   [[eosio::action]]
   void hi(name user) {
      print("Hello, ", user);
   }
};

EOSIO_DISPATCH(example, (hi))
```

### 3. Compile the Smart Contract
Use EOSIO.CDT to compile the smart contract.

```bash
eosio-cpp -o example.wasm example.cpp --abigen
```

### 4. Deploy the Smart Contract
Deploy the contract using Cleos (command-line tool for interacting with EOSIO-based blockchains).

```bash
cleos -u https://testnet.waxsweden.org set contract <account> <path_to_compiled_contract>
```

### 5. Test the Smart Contract
Interact with the contract using Cleos or any other tool that allows interaction with the blockchain.

```bash
cleos -u https://testnet.waxsweden.org push action youraccount hi '["yourwaxaccount"]' -p youraccount@active
```

## Additional Tools

- **EOSIO.CDT (Contract Development Toolkit)**: A comprehensive suite for developing EOSIO-based smart contracts.
- **Cleos**: Command-line interface for interacting with EOSIO-based blockchains.
- **EOS Studio**: An integrated development environment (IDE) specifically for EOSIO smart contract development.
- **Scatter**: A wallet and toolkit that can be used for development.
- **Bloks.io**: A block explorer and interface that provides interaction capabilities.

## Notes

- Ensure you replace `<account>` and `<path_to_compiled_contract>` with your actual account name and path to the compiled contract file.
- For more information and detailed documentation, refer to the [EOSIO Documentation](https://developers.eos.io/).
